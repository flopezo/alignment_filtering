SJS 5/29/14. Details on files contained within alignment_filtering/data/ .
Contact Stephanie at stephanie.spielman@gmail.com with any questions, etc.


pp90/ 
	Contains datafiles generated either by either alignment_filtering/scripts/parsing/parsefubar.py or parsepaml.py, which gather performance information for a posterior probability of 0.9 of calling positive selection. These data files contain most information used in data analysis. 
	The files ending in "_RAWSTATS.txt" only contain information about the NUMBER of false positives, true positives, etc. They were generated by the same parsepaml.py and parsefubar.py scripts, just with some local script modifications to what was printed to the outfile. 

sweeps/
	Contains datafiles generated by alignment_filtering/scripts/sweepfubar.py and sweeppaml.py. These data files contain information needed to plot ROC curves. They gather performance information swept across posterior probability cutoffs 0-1 for all simulation sets.

stats/
	Contain files for R code and output from R to generate statistics on alignment filtering. See each file *code.txt for details about what exactly it is producing. Note that some of the output files have been manually tweaked (added comments or spacing) for easier interpretation of results.
