README for alignment_filtering/scripts/simulation/HA. SJS.

Contains files used to infer evolutionary parameters from H1N1 HA.

aln_aa_H1N1_HA.fasta  -> amino acid alignment
aln_nuc_H1N1_HA.fasta  -> back-translated nucleotide alignment
tree_H1N1_HA.tre      -> RAxML constructed phylogeny from nucleotide sequences using GTRGAMMA model

HyPhy_files/ contains files to run evolutionary rate inference with HyPhy on the alignment.
	To repeat this analysis, run HYPHYMP REL_5cat.bf. The files GY94_Header.ibf (contains misc functions needed for analysis), matrix.mdl (contains instantaneous matrix), and hyin_H1N1_NP.txt (contains input data - alignment and tree) must be in the same working directory as REL_5cat.bf. You should get a file out similar to what is seem in H1N1_HA.out. Site rates may be inferred using this file using a Bayes Empirical Bayes approach. 
	

get_eqfreqs.txt obtains the codon frequencies from the file 50seqs_HA.fasta, which contains the first 50 sequences (without gaps) from the HA alignment. As sequences are in random order, we expect that this contains a random selection of 50 sequences from the total 1038. This was done for tractability. The frequencies returned from this script are shown, commented out, in the script itself. They were used as input parameters for sequence simulation in Indelible (Fletcher and Yang 2009).
