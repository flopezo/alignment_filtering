README for alignment_filtering/scripts/simulation/params. SJS.

Contains files used to infer evolutionary parameters from GP41 (HIV) and HA (H1N1).

get_eqfreqs.py  -  script to obtain codon frequencies from a given file. The files used for this were HA/50seqs_HA.fasta and GP41/50seqs_GP41.txt , each of which contain the first 50 sequences of their respective datasets. As sequences are all in random order, this contains a random selection of 50 sequences from the total. This was done for tractability. The frequencies returned from this script are shown, commented out, in the script itself. They were used as input parameters for sequence simulation in Indelible (Fletcher and Yang 2009).

HA/
50seqs_HA.fasta
aln_aa_H1N1_HA.fasta  -> amino acid alignment
aln_nuc_H1N1_HA.fasta  -> back-translated nucleotide alignment
tree_H1N1_HA.tre      -> RAxML constructed phylogeny from nucleotide sequences using GTRGAMMA model

In each directory, HA and GP41, you'll see this - 
HyPhy_files/ contains files to run evolutionary rate inference with HyPhy on the alignment.
	To repeat this analysis, run HYPHYMP REL_5cat.bf. The files GY94_Header.ibf (contains misc functions needed for analysis), matrix.mdl (contains instantaneous matrix). The input file (either hyin_H1N1_NP.txt or gp41.nex must be in the same working directory as REL_5cat.bf. You should get a file out similar to what is seen in H1N1_HA.out or GP41.out. Site rates may be inferred using this file using a Bayes Empirical Bayes approach.
