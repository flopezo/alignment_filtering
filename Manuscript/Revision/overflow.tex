 high divergences; for instance, a typical mammalian gene tree's mean-path-length is only about 0.17 \citep{Spielman2013}, less than 10\% the divergence level at which \citet{Jordan2012} detected improvements when using the Guidance filter. In sum, previous studies on the benefits of filtering alignments with Guidance before inferring positive selection gave distinct recommendations; while \citet{Privman2012} advocated the filter's use, \citet{Jordan2012} primarily promoted using high-quality alignment software rather than relying on alignment filtering. 
 
 Moreover, under certain circumstances, masking residues at too strict a threshold had the potential to worsen positive-selection inference, relative to an unfiltered alignment.
 
We chose to use only linsi because it strongly outperforms other progressive alignment softwares for protein alignments without sacrificing speed \citep{Nuin2006,Thompson2011}. 

We inferred all phylogenies used for these inferences from the unfiltered amino-acid MSAs in RAxML \citep{Stamatakis2006}, using the PROTGAMMAWAG using the GTR model \citep{Stamatakis2006C} under the WAG substitution matrix \citep{Whelan2001}. All filtered alignments derived from the same unfiltered alignment were analyzed with the same phylogeny to remove any potential bias.

Note that we use PAML throughout this paper to refer specifically to its M8 model

In total, we inferred positive selection for 5200 alignments with FUBAR and 3900 alignments with PAML. % this is definitely incorrect now. rethink.
