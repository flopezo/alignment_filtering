INTRODUCTION
-----------------------------------------------------
1.1 Description
	This program runs a masking algorithm similar to GUIDANCE <CITATION>,
	which aims to improve false positive rates in protein alignments. It is
	provided as supplementary material.

1.2 Dependencies
	SJSGuidance requires:
		1. A C compiler which supports the C++ 2011 Standards (Tested with Intel 13 and GCC 4.8)
		2. MUSCLE, MAFFT, or ClustalW for alignment (mafft is preferable; use of the others will
		require modifying the code and is not recommended).
		3. FasTree is required for building perturbed guide trees
		4. RAxML is required for performing phylogenetic weighting.
		5. Dendropy must be installed and on the PYTHONPATH.

	Installing MAFFT:
	MAFFT is published and supported by Kazutaka Katoh at AIST. It can be freely installed
	from this page:
	http://mafft.cbrc.jp/alignment/software/
	It requires a modern C compiler. To ensure it is on the system path, try typing "which mafft"
	on the command line. If this fails, please append the mafft binaries to the system path.

	Installing FasTree
	FasTree is a rapid treebuilder used to make guide trees. It is freely available from the following site:
	http://www.microbesonline.org/fasttree/
	Installation instructions are available from the website. FasTree is so quick we decided not to implement
	OpenMP support in our code, so there's no need to worry about anything but the basic install.

	Installing Dendropy
	Dendropy is a python library for Python 2.x which performs a variety of phylogenetic computing
	functions. It is freely available from:
	http://pythonhosted.org/DendroPy/
	It requires nothing but a working python install.

RUNNING SJSGUIDANCE
-----------------------------------------------------
3.1 Command Line Flags

	-infile <INFILE.fasta> or -infile <INFILE.fa>
	A file in FASTA format which contains amino acid sequences to be aligned.
	The user will be prompted if no file is provided.

	-n <NUM_THREADS>
	Takes an integer argument for the number of hardware threads to use. This number should
	be less than the total number of cores in the machines.

	-bootstraps <NUM_BOOTSTRAPS>
	Takes an integer argument for the number of bootstraps. If no argument is given,
	ten will be performed.

	-alphabet protein or -alphabet nucleotide
	The alphabet to use for analysis. Protein is the default and is supplied if no
	argument is given.

3.2 Usage
python sjs_guidance.py
	Running this will prompt the user for the infile and use the default options for
	threads and bootstraps.

python sjs_guidance.py -infile <MYFILE>.fasta -n 2 -bootstraps 20
	Running this will perform analysis using 2 threads and 20 bootstraps.

NB: Arguments are not positional, so any ordering should be fine (e.g. switching -n and
-bootstraps in the previous line). It is recommended the user fill in as many flags as possible
to run exactly the analysis they desire.
